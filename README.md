### GUI wrapper for Factorio Headless Server (for Window)

# Requirements:
- Any IDEs which support C# 7.0 (I'm using VS2017)
- .NET Framework 4.0 (Client Profile): Full Profile included Client Profile as well. So you don't need to install if you have already.

## Remind:
- This is a mess. Please forgive me~
- It's incompleted.
- This is a wrapper, which mean it will interact with the factorio process (running in headless mode) in background.
